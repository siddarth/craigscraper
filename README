== About

Craigscraper can be used to scrape listings from craigslist. Craigscraper
uses PStore to manage duplicates, based on a simple hash table to eliminate
similar postings.

== Usage

Download a copy of it:
    $ git clone git://github.com/siddarth/craigscraper.git

Navigate to the correct directory.
    $ cd craigscraper/

Install bundler:
    $ gem install bundler

Install the dependencies:
    $ bundle install

Run the Craigscraper executable.
    $ bin/craigscraper

The output is stored in listings.txt, and should also be printed to standard
out.
