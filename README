== About

Craigscraper can be used to scrape listings from craigslist. Craigscraper
uses PStore to manage duplicates, based on a simple hash table to eliminate
similar postings.

== Usage

Download a copy of it:

    $ git clone git://github.com/siddarth/craigscraper.git

Run the script in the correct directory.

    $ cd craigscraper/
    $ ./craigscraper

The output is stored in listings.txt, and should also be printed to standard
out.
